##### SUMMARY

I like IT, I think it is our future. After 10 years of working in Art field I have decided to change my life and devote myself to Information Technologies area.

I have started searching for what I want to do in IT sphere. 
At first, I completed software testing course. It was interesting but I wanted more. After that I have entered *the Institute of information technologies BSUIR*, and now I am extremely happy. I communicate with intelligent, creative people who are true fans of what they do. It motivates me so much to reach my own goals.

I have already learnt _HTML5 and CSS3, worked with programs Photoshop, Illustrator, 3d-max._

Now I’m studying programming languages like: Python, JavaScript, SQL.

__My biggest goal for now is to know these languages extremely well.__ Every day I approach to my goal step by step!
